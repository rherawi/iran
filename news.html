                    <p>
                         Civil unrest and protests against the government of Iran associated with the
                         death in police custody of Mahsa Amini began on 16 September 2022 and are 
                         ongoing as of February 2023. Amini had been arrested by the Guidance Patrol 
                         for allegedly violating Iran's mandatory hijab law by wearing her hijab 
                         "improperly" while visiting Tehran from Saqqez. According to eyewitnesses, 
                         she had been severely beaten by Guidance Patrol officers, an assertion denied
                         by Iranian authorities. As the protests spread from Amini's hometown of Saqqez
                         to other cities in the province of Kurdistan and throughout the country, 
                         the government responded with widespread Internet blackouts, nationwide restrictions
                         on social media usage tear gas and gunfire.

                    <p>
                         Pirooz, who was the only survivor of the birth of the Asiatic cheetah, 
                         "Iran", had become one of the symbols of Iran's nationwide protests 
                         in the last few months, so that in the last few days and at the same 
                         time as the concern about his kidney failure and his physical
                         condition increased, social networks were filled with  It was from
                         the messages related to him.
                         Efforts to save Pirooz, the cheetah cub that was kept in Tehran's
                         Pardisan Park, were unsuccessful and finally 
                         Pirooz died in the early hours of Tuesday.

                    <p>
                         While detentions, beatings and expulsions against female students participating 
                         in anti-regime protests continue in schools in Iran, more than 800 students in 
                         16 provinces have been poisoned by chemical gas so far.

                         While the source of the gas cannot be determined, many believe that these attacks,
                         which started in November, were carried out deliberately to prevent schools from 
                         closing and girls from going to school. 
                        
                         A senior Iranian official also confirmed that female students were specifically targeted.
                         None of the students lost their lives, but dozens of them were hospitalized with 
                         complaints such as respiratory problems, dizziness and fatigue.
